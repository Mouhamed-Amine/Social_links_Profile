### Building your project

1. Initialize The project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community .
2. Configure the repository to publish your code to a web address. 
3. I Look through the designs to start planning out how i'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, I structure the content with HTML. Writing the HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5.I Write out the base styles for the project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only I move on to the next section once am happy with completing the area am working on.

### Deploying your project

There are many ways to host your project for free.

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

I wanna focus on : 
- Adding 3D animation to the background.

- Make the Content Customizable for people to use.
